          <p>Melinda started Red Leg Graphic Design in 2017. She is a 2005 graduate of Dakota State University with a B.A. in Graphic Design, and has been in the business every since. Her favorite jobs are then ones where she can use her creativity to give the customer an outstanding profession product. No job is too small; some weather is logo design or graduation announcements. In 2015 Melinda and her husband became part owners and coaches at Glacial Lakes CrossFit, there she really honed her marketing skills designing everything from flyers, pamphlets, T-shirts, business cards and even the business’ sign. Melinda named the company Red Leg Graphics for her affiliation with the U.S. Field Artillery where she is a recipient of the Molly Pitcher Award, and an honorary Artilleryman. She has volunteered with her husband’s Family Readiness group and is currently a member of the Watertown Sea of Goodwill, an organization dedicated to helping local veterans and their families.
